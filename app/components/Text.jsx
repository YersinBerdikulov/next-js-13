        Features of Our Resource
      </h3>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
        The main feature of our service is absolute and complete anonymity. Want to watch Stories? Please do. Want to download videos and photos? No problem. Want to see who left likes and comments under posts? That information will also be available.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
        Another feature of InstaNavigation is that you don't need to first log into your account, provide a password, and then set up an anonymous mode to use the service. It's much simpler; all you need to do is specify the username of the person you're interested in in a certain field. This is a convenient and well-thought-out approach.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
        On the one hand, it serves as an additional security measure. If you don't enter any data, you don't have to worry about it being disclosed. On the other hand, it allows users who are not registered on Instagram to also view interesting pages on the social network.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <strong className="text-gray-900">No Account or Registration Required</strong><br />
        The service can be used by everyone. Not only do you not need to have a profile on the social network, but you also don't need to install any additional software. Everything can be done through the browser page.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <strong className="text-gray-900">Nobody Knows About Your Activity</strong><br />
        With InstaNavigation, you can do anything and keep an eye on anyone. Our service makes your presence invisible to the owners of other accounts.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <strong className="text-gray-900">Ability to Download Content</strong><br />
        With InstaNavigation, not only can you view the content, but you can also save it. It doesn't matter what device you are using. You can save photos and videos in high quality, whether on a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or computer. Now you don't have to worry about not being able to save something important.
